# mom_project
This project is a web page to display different events to connect moms with kids to others who are in the same age range or interest.  Really just a safe space for a community to come together and semi privately find time and locations to link. 
You can register to become a member after which point you will log in to view your dashboard displaying your current events you have RSVPâ€™d to as well as another list of upcoming events. You can create an event, update or delete as well. You can comment on events and see what others have asked too.
